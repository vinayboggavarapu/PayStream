# PayStream

Hi there! We are team ***Team Ezap*** , made this project as part of the ***EthForAll*** .
Basically our idea is to make pay as you watch model which replaces the conventional subscription basis Model of Video Streaming Platforms.
They are certain user who anticipate to watch only a particular movie in a particular video platform so, he needs tobuy the subscription of entire month.
We believe if this can be replaced by Pay as you Watch , it can benefit other end users..

*To solve this problem , we believe SuperFluid is a great Protocol to stream money automatically based on the Time..*
